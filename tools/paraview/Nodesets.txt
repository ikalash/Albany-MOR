To view nodesets in Paraview:

1. Load the exodus file as usual.
2. Scroll down the Properties menu, past the "Apply Displacements" button, you should see a "Sets" dialog.
3. Select the nodesets that you wish to view.
4. Hit "Apply"
5. Select a field to color on, other than the default "Solid Color", in the main view menu. The nodes in the set will be colored
   based on this selection. It is often most helpful to select "GlobalNodeId", the residual or solution node fields to color the
   nodeset with. Verify that "Surface" is selected in the view menu.
6. Load the exodus file *again*, and then hit "Apply".

Note that the file is loaded again in the "Pipeline Browser"; verify that the "eyeball" for both files are active, and that the
second (lowest) file is highlighted. Verify that "Solid Color" and "Surface" are selected in the view menu.

One should see the nodes of the nodeset slightly elevated (and colored based on GlobalNodeId or the selected fields) above a solid
gray surface of the part.
