This documents lists to-dos to get Albany working when
KOKKOS_UNDER_DEVELOPMENT is turned ON.

Commented out ifdefs: 
- src/Aeras/evaluators/Aeras_ComputeBasisFunctions*.hpp
- src/LCM/models/J2Model_Def.hpp (kernel need to be re-written when MiniTensor
  is moved to Kokkos)
- src/evaluators/PHAL_ComputeBasisFunctions*.hpp (kokkos kernels are implemented
for 3D only. Wait until Compute Basis functions kernels are implemented in
Intrepid)
- src/evaluators/PHAL_GatherSolution*.hpp  (need to fix memory leak with
Kokkos::vector)

Failing tests when KOKKOS_UNDER_DEVELOPMENT is ON + SERIAL node: 
The following tests FAILED:
                        34 - MPNIQuad2D_SG (Failed)
