This file summarizes what is missing in Trilinos / Albany as of Oct. 2014, which 
prevents running the AlbanyT executable in the Albany Tpetra branch.

General TO DOs: 
- Turn on SCOREC in nightly tests (Irina)
- Turn on DAKOTA in nightly tests (Irina).
- Shorten Aeras tests run with AlbanyT executable, make consistent w/ Albany tests. 

Things that don't work right now if ALBANY_EPETRA_EXE is turned OFF: 
- QCAD will work only with Albany executable.
- MOR will work only with Albany executable.
- SG_MP will work only with Albany executable.
- ATO will work only with Albany executable. 
- catalyst - can't build, need ParaView source code? 
- Teko stuff (uses Epetra) -- do not need? 
- Albany_Dakota (TriKota).
- peridigm - have David Littlewood test, for now will not convert to tpetra.
- some adaptivity stuff will not work.  Check with Glen what.
- Need to fix Aeras test cases and AlbanyAnalysisT test case which fail if ALBANY_EPETRA_EXE is off.
- SaveEigenData and related files.
- Albany_ObserverFactory, Albany_NOXObserver, Albany_RythmosObserver (these are based on EpetraExt; likely can be 
converted to Thyra, like Albany_PiroObserverT).
- Lament needs libraries... -- but we decided not to pursue lament (which was templated version of lame). 
- There are inconsistencies b/w ST and double, GO and int, etc. throughout the code.  Needs to be cleaned up.


Question: is there a way to test compilation of Albany tpetra branch with ALBANY_EPETRA_EXE turned off 
w/o Epetra?  E.g., remove library linking from link line?  Unfortunately it's not possible to 
turn off Epetra in Trilinos b/c some packages (e.g., Piro, Zoltan2) have dependencies on Epetra.  

Piro: 
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_RythmosSolver* to piro package of Trilinos.  
Without this, it is not possible to select specialized time integration schemes
with the AlbanyT executable.  Albany problems affected: Aeras, ComprNS, LinComprNS, 
NSRayleighBernard2D, NSVortexShedding2D.
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_InvertMassMatrixDecorator* to piro package of Trilinos.
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_VelocityVerletSolver* to piro package of Trilinos.
This requires extending the Thyra model evaluator to work with xdotdot.
Albany problems affected: 
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_TrapezoidRuleSolver* to piro package of Trilinos.
Albany problems affected: LCM/Dynamics 
-  Matrix-Free in Piro is only for Epetra. It is needed for Peridigm (Dave Littlewood).

Ifpack2: 
- It appears ILU is not available in Ifpack2, just ILUT. (RILUK?)


MueLu:
- The following tests that use MueLu have a seg fault.  Need to figure out what is the problem:
FELIX/FO_Test/input_fo_confinedShelf.xml (seg fault in parallel only)
FELIX/FO_Test/input_fo_confinedShelf_depthIntBC.xml (seg fault in parallel only)
QCAD/Poisson/input_mosdot_3D_tet10.xml (seg fault only with MueLu, not with Ifpack2) 
- The following examples required "aggregation: local aggregates" and "aggregation: nodes per aggregate" 
to be implemented in the METIS/ParMETIS interface:
LCM/MechanicsWithTemperature/ThermalExpansion.xml
LCM/MechanicsWithTemperature/MechanicsWithTemperature.xml
- How to get ML symmetric Gauss-Seidel with MueLu?   Affects
LCM/StabilizedTet4/galerkin.xml
FELIX/FO_Test/input_fo_confinedShelf.xml
FELIX/FO_Test/input_fo_confinedShelf_deptIntBC.xml


Amesos2: 
- Amesos2 is not at all hooked up to Stratimikos.  Need to do this.  
Albany problems affected: LCM/ThermoPoroMechanics3D, LCM/TLPoroElasticity2D, 
LCM/TLPoroElasticity3D, LCM/UnSatPoroElasticity3D, LCM/MechanicsPorePressure/inputOrthogonalFlow.xml

QCAD: 
The following need to be filled in for all of QCAD's capabilities to work with the AlbanyT executable.
- QCAD::CoupledPoissonSchrodinger, QCAD::GenEigensolver and QCAD::Solver classes need to be implemented 
to use the Thyra::ModelEvuator instead of the Epetra::ExtModelEvaluator.  Once that's done, Albany_SolverFactory.cpp 
needs to be modified to call these.  Right now there is an error thrown if one tries to call "QCAD Multi-Physics", 
"Eigensolve" or "QCAD Poisson-Schrodinger" with the AlbanyT executable.
- QCAD::CoupledPSJacobian, QCAD::CoupledPSPreconditioner, QCAD::MultiSolutionObserver need to be implemented
with Tpetra instead of Epetra objects.  It appears QCAD::CoupledPSObserver is not used (is that right?) 
- QCAD::GreensFunctionTunneling response needs to be converted to Tpetra.
- Irina K. converted QCAD::SaddleValueResponseFunction to Tpetra some time back.  Need to check that the conversions are up-to-date and complete.
- There is a seg fault when running input_mosdot3D_tet10.xml with MueLu preconditioner (not Ifpack2).  Need to look into why (before 
checking with MueLu developers, need to check if problem is in Albany or MueLu).
- I believe NOX::Epetra::Observer does not have a Thyra/Tpetra analog and needs to be 
implemented in nox, for SaveEigenDataConstructor and NOXObserverConstructor functions to work 
in Albany::SolverFactory class. 


Comments:
- "NOX" can be called in parameter list under "Piro" instead of "ThyraNOX" when 
running with the AlbanyT executable (e.g., SteadyHeat2D/inputThyra.xml, TransientHeat2D/inputThyra.xml). 
- All examples in Albany tpetra branch have been converted to use Belos instead of AztecOO. 
The latter will not work with the AlbanyT executable if requesting more than 1 
sensitivity (epetraToThyra and MV dimension != 1 error).  
- For the following example, needed to lower nonlinear solver tolerance to get same response, due 
to difference in solve history with MueLu compared to ML: 
LCM/ThermoElasticity3D/inputT.xml 
- For the following example, the response changed slightly with AlbanyT executable 
compared to when run with Albany executable (in 6th decimal point).  Ended up rebaselining 
example since nothing looked significantly off/different.
LCM/MechanicsTensileTet10/NotchedTensileTet10T.xml 


TO DOs (Irina K., Andy, Andrew Bradley, et al.):
- Figure out AlbanyAnalysisT executable error.  Test AlbanyAnalysisT executable when code has been built with DAKOTA (Andy).
- Look into sensitivity / response discrepancies in FELIX/FO_Test and LCM/Mechanics2D 
- Figure out time growing unbounded issue in LCM/Catalyst, LCM/Elasticity3DPressureBC, LCM/LaplaceBeltrami/2DCylMotion, LCM/StabilizedTet4
- Convert QCAD suite to use Thyra model evaluator instead of EpetraExt model evaluator.
- Figure out NaNs in LCM/MechanicsPorePressure/inputMechanics.xml (email Jake?)  
- Figure out why "Piro Defaults Filename" is not recognized by AlbanyT executable for QCAD/Schrodinger/*qcad.xml problems
- Anasazi seg fault when running inputT.xml for NSVortexShedding2D problem. 
- Sensitivities are different when running with Belos comapred to AztecOO for FELIX_Stokes/FO_Test/*interpSurf.xml (with Albany executable)!
- Different responses when running with Belos than AztecOO for: LinComprNS/input2D_drivenPulse.xml, LinComprNS/input3Dunsteady.xml, 
LinComprNS/input3DunsteadyNS.xml...
- Cleanups involving TpetraBuild flag?
