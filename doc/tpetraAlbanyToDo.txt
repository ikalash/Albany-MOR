Tpetra Albany branch to-dos: 

- There is now some divergence b/w the Albany master branch and the Albany tpetra branch 
due to the Adaptivity class.  For instance, the functions initial_x, initial_x_dot, etc. are 
no longer a part of the Albany_Application class in the master branch; rather they are 
members of the Adaptivity class.  The problem with moving these functions to the Adaptivity 
class in the tpetra branch is there are some Trilinos functions called in the Adaptivity 
class that are not implemented for Thyra (and therefore Tpetra).  These functions need to 
be added to Trilinos, and the tpetra branch reconciled properly, removing these divergences 
b/w the tpetra and master branches. 

- saveResidualFieldT() (a tpetra version of saveResidualField()) needs to be added to 
Albany_STKDiscretization.cpp.  This will require converting saveResVector to Tpetra (i.e., 
need to create a Tpetra version of this function, e.g., saveResVectorT).  Then saveResidualFieldT 
can be called in Albany_Application.cpp like saveResidualField is currently called.  This is needed 
only for some LCM problems.
