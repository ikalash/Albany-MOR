clone-build-test-mail.sh

This simple test harness script relies on the build scripts and
templates residing in ../build/amota.

As with the scripts in that directory, clone-build-test-mail.sh must
reside in the directory just above the Trilinos and Albany directories
(top level).

Executing this script will erase all traces of any previous builds
under the top level directory, attempt to clone both Trilinos and
Albany from the repositories specified within the script, configure,
build and test Albany with all compilers and all build types, and
email the results of the tests to the email address specified within.

The script also produces cloning, configuration, build, error and test
logs that are placed in the top level directory. Any previous logs are
overwritten.
