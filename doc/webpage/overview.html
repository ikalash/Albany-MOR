        <a href="about.html"> About </a> - 
        Albany is an PDE application code that demonstrates how to make
        use of all the capabilities in the Trilinos framework. It is a testbed
        for new algorithms and software, a prototype code to serve as a template
        for new code efforts, and a research platform for embedded algorithms.

        Albany is serves as the platform for a few application research and
        development projects. These include:

<ul>
        LCM: the Laboratory for
        Computational Mechanics, an open-source platform for development of
        material models and solution algorithms for mechanics applications.

        QCAD: QCAD is a quantum device simulation code, based on solving the coupled Schrodinger-Poisson system.

        FELIX: A code for the simulation of ice sheet dynamics, as part of the
        PISCEES SciDAC-BER project.
</ul>
