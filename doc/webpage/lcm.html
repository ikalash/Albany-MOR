<p class="heading"> Laboratory for Computational Mechanics </p>

The Laboratory for Computational Mechanics (LCM) is an R&D effort
built on the Albany code base. The purpose of the LCM is to develop a
computational mechanics research environment that facilitates
collaboration and impacts the Sandia production analysis codes.

<p class="section"><b> Getting Started </b></p>

Development within the LCM environment requires an installation of
Trilinos and a few TPLs. To facilitate a common environment setup,
there are a couple of build scripts in the Albany repository that
fetch and build Trilinos and the required TPLs. They can be found at the location
<tt>Albany/src/LCM/doc/*_build.sh</tt>. These scripts build a recent
version of the GCC compiler, including its dependencies, and proceed
to fetch and build current version of NetCDF, Boost, CMake, and
OpenMPI. Prereq's for the script are an installation of git and the
standard BLAS and LAPACK libraries. If everything goes smoothly, you
will have a clean installation of Trilinos and Albany's tests will
pass.

<p class="section"><b> Fracture and Failure </b></p>

The focus of the LCM is on developing mechanics algorithms related to
modeling fracture and failure of materials. For more information, see
the <a href="http://firebird.ran.sandia.gov/solid-mechanics/"><span>solid
    mechanics collaboration website</span></a>.

<p class="section"><b> Multiphysics </b></p>

The design of Albany allows for the rapid prototyping of multiphysics
systems, as evident by a number of ongoing efforts underneath the LCM
umbrella. Each of these efforts involves the solution of multiple
balance laws with coupled solution fields, in the context of fully
nonlinear, finite deformation continuum mechanics. A few represented
examples will be discussed.

<p class="sub section"><i> Thermomechanics </i></p>

The treatment of thermomechanics includes a formulation of the balance
of energy, in temperature form, coupled with the balance of linear
momentum. Implicit, quasi-static time integration applies to the
equilibrium equations, with transient heat conduction stemming from
the balance of energy. Finite deformation kinematics leads to a
description of physics in the reference configuration, with
temperature dependent material parameters and constitutive response,
including J<sub>2</sub> inelasticity. Finally, mechanical source terms
are present in the energy equation describing structural elastic and
inelastic heating as well as internal dissipation.

<p class="section"><b> Organization and Project Management </b></p>

The LCM project leverages existing research projects in the areas of
computational mechanics. The stated objective is to provide an
environment whereby a researcher can focus on the new idea and/or
algorithm, and not be responsible for re-implementing functionality
required for simulation, but outside the scope of the research. For
example, existing parsing, I/O, parallel communication functionality
can be leveraged and reused seamlessly. A schmatic of the operational
space of the LCM project can be seen in the figure below.
