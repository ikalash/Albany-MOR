    dofs: u, v, w, p
    viscosity = Glen's law
    Same problem statement as input_fo_ismip-hom_testA.xml, except the physics 
    are the full Stokes equations.  Currently, an equal-order
    velocity-pressure finite element pair with a pressure PSPG stabilization 
    (stabilization parameter: tau = delta*h^2) is used to solve the problem.
