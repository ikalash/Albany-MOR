Note:

This directory holds the dashboard scripts that run on shannon.sandia.gov, that builds and runs the Albany_CUDA
tests and stores the results in the Testing directory. A server machine, cee-compute012, then scp's the results
files and then posts those to the CDash server on the SRN, cdash.sandia.gov
