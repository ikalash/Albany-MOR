\section alb_intro Introduction 

Albany is a PDE code built from numerous Trilinos packages. 



Albany is a parallel, unstructured grid finite element code, 
complete with transformational analysis capabilities such
as embedded optimization and UQ. It serves as a testbed,
a development environment, and an example code for
the algorithms, interfaces and software quality tools
in the Trilinos framework.
