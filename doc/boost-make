# This is a configure/make script for  boost  needed for Dakota builds.
#
# When building Albany without Dakota (i.e. without TriKota being
# enabled in Trilinos), a simple download of boost will suffice.
#
# Dakota has a dependency (as of 11/2011) on four boost libraries.
# The following 2 lines should build these libraries and install
# them in a lib subdirectory. 
#
# The Trilinos script should include this line:
#    -D Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS:FILEPATH="$BOOSTDIR/lib" \
#
# This file should be copied to the top "boost" directory and executed.
