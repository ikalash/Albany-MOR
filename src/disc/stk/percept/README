This directory and subdirectories includes the stk_rebalance capability
out of percept. Here are modifications I made:

1. Change CMakeLists files to build as part of Albany instead of Trilinos

2. For my convenience, I merged stk_rebalance_utils into stk_rebalance dirs

3. stk_rebalance had a single dependence on Percept: class MyPairIterRelation 
   So, I stripped the contents of PerceptMesh.hpp down to just this class
   and put it in a new header  Percept_MyPairIterRelation.hpp
   My new version of PerceptMesh.hpp simply includes this file.

   In  Percept_MyPairIterRelation.hpp, 
   I had to comment out the constructor that had PerceptMesh in the
   argument list: this was not defined with my stripped-down version and
   only the contructor taking BulkData is used in stk_rebalance.

4. To get stk_rebalance to compile, without  stk::mesh::Cartesian Not Found
   error, I needed to add  #include <stk_mesh/base/CoordinateSystems.hpp>
   in Partition.hpp

5. In RebalanceUtils.cpp: needed to add #include <stk_meh/base/MetaData.hpp>
